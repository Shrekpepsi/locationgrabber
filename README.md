# locationgrabber
A live location data gather app module to generate dataset using MERN stack

# To run the project 
Do the following to run the project:

1-Open Node Api file & run the server on local host using command: node server.js

2-Open Stickersmasher file & run the react native expo cli using command : npm run start

3-Your MongoDb cluster should be in active state.


# Important Note

-Change the endpoint path url according to your own ipv4 address as it may introduce axios network error if u you don't ( Both local host and the emulator/device should be running on the same network)

-Edit the connection string for your own mongodb atlas in node api file for successfull db connection.

-If any dependencies are deprecated use command to update if needed: npm install -g 

-Can be run on physical device as well as emulator( physical device prefered for real time location compatiblity)
